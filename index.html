        <h3>Horror is arguably the most subjective genre in the film industry, 
            as there are so many different sub-genres within the spectrum. 
            The basis distinguishing a good horror movie from a great horror movie is different for
             everyone. Some fans love body horror, while others get the heebie-jeebies from a strong
            possession film. Today, unlike any other time in cinema, there is a divide between fans who like ‚Äúelevated horror‚Äù and slasher gore. Elevated horror is a sub-genre that typically 
            takes on an opinion or an overall message and masks it behind fear or whatever the film is portraying. These films differ wildly from slashers, and classics that came from the 1980s.
